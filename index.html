                    <h2>Why Is This Course Relevant Today?</h2>
                    <p>There's never been a better time to start a career as a web developer
                         because there is a consistent demand for developers 
                        who both write high-quality code and experienced problem solvers 
                        who can design creative solutions.

                            The web and the applications built for it have transformed 
                            the way we do business globally, and is disrupting industries from 
                            education to manufacturing.</p>

                            <h2>What Practical Skill Sets Can I Expect To Have 
                                Upon Completion Of The Course?</h2>
                                <p>By the end of the course, you will have gained practice in the most
                                     used web-based programming language – JavaScript. You’ll have built
                                      several full-stack applications of varying complexity, and have 
                                      experience working with a team in a development environment.

                                        You’ll gain confidence in tackling new technologies in an 
                                        ever-changing field. You’ll have gained foundational skill in 
                                        many disciplines that touch web development – managing complex 
                                        data sets, securing your applications with encrypted passwords,
                                        and testing and deploying your applications to prepare them to 
                                        scale.</p>

                               <h2>Should I Come Equipped With Anything?</h2>
                               <p>Yes, a laptop is required (either Mac or PC) with a minimum
                                    of 4GB RAM with a storage capacity of at least 350GB. The course 
                                    will walk you through installing the necessary free software.

                                    At least, you’ll require basic secondary school mathematics,
                                     but no previous programming language experience is required.,<br><br><br>

                    </ul>

                    <h2>What Does Success In This Program Look Like?</h2>
                    <p>To get the most out of this course, you have to be willing to fully
                         immerse yourself (get it?) in the classroom environment. This means
                          actively engaging with your instructors, classmates, and career 
                          coach, as well as taking every opportunity to apply your new 
                          skills toward real-life projects.

                            We’ll help guide you through the entire process,
                             but in order to succeed you’ll need to completely commit to
                              your work and continuously push yourself.</p>
